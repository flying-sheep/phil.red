Expectations and Disappointment
===============================

It’s your responsibility to deal with your frustration when you wanted someone to want something, and they don’t.

Getting to know someone means you build a mental model of their behavior.
You spend enough time around them that you come to trust this model to predict how they are going to react to something.
And then they don’t.
And you were actually looking forward to the other response they could have given, the one they didn’t give.
This feeling is called “frustration”.

Now there are a few ways people tend to go from here. E.g.

    I don’t deserve to feel frustrated, that’s not fair.
    This person is not very nice to do that to me.

We could say, they expect the other person to be able to read minds –
to react in a way that caters to the unspoken expectations of someone else.

or

    I really believed that person to be the kind of person that would have done the other thing.
    Maybe they just did this thing I didn’t like that one time, that would be naughty of them.
    Or it’s a character flaw of them to be the kind of person that doesn’t do that.

In other words, they are filling in the blanks in their mental model with themselves;
they apply their own personal standards to someone else who never agreed to live by these rules.

The other way to react
----------------------

I often have to remind myself of the rationalist mantra. [1]_

.. epigraph::

   As a rationalist, my strength is to be more confused by fiction than reality.
   I notice that I am confused.
   Therefore either something I believe is fiction or this story is.

And often in such situations, you know that something you believe is fiction.

While the rationalist mantra leaves open the door for the story to be false,
most people don’t tend to knowingly violate expectations to hurt others.
But if you aren’t in a situation that is so toxic that you can expect that to be the case,
don’t make the situation toxic by expecting the worst, but think “I notice that I am confused …”

PS: People tend to forget rules that rarely come into play.
Especially if they aren’t aware of how important they are to you.
So make sure that close others know what’s important to you.

.. [1] The problems in the rationalist community notwithstanding, they do have nice ideals.
