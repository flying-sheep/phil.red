Identity is an illusion
=======================

I’ve been thinking a lot about the `teletransportation paradox`_.
As I’m not the first one to do so, I enjoyed the many takes by media creators.
Videos such as videos like John Weldon’s `To Be`_ or `the Trouble with Transporters`_ by CGP Grey;
comics like the very first Existential Comic `the Machine`_, or the many takes on `teleporter problems`_ by SMBC.
The first three are nice explainy ones that might clean up the residual confusion that might potentially remain after my upcoming explanation!
Skip to `the issues`_ if you clicked any of these links (except for the SMBC one) or already know

The basics

Again, this is well explained by e.g. `the Machine`_, but here’s a quick summary:

The issues
----------
Me enjoying these pieces of media doesn’t mean that they don’t have their issues.
Chief among them is equating an interruption of consiousness with sleep;
neurons fire even in dreamless sleep, so despite sleep being held as *the* example for loss of consciousness, mental activity doesn’t cease, it just changes.

Yet a simple twist can fix that: cryonics.
A frozen brain really truly has no consciousness, yet if it’s possible for a `wood frog`_ to wake up from being frozen, it’s believable that we could, too.
