Identity is an illusion
=======================

I’ve been thinking a lot about the `teletransportation paradox`_.
As I’m not the first one to do so, I enjoyed the many takes by media creators.
Videos such as videos like John Weldon’s `To Be`_ or `the Trouble with Transporters`_ by CGP Grey;
comics like the very first Existential Comic `the Machine`_, or the many takes on `teleporter problems`_ by SMBC.
The first three are nice explainy ones that might clean up the residual confusion that might potentially remain after my upcoming explanation!
Skip to `the issues`_ if you clicked any of these links (except for the SMBC one) or already know

The basics
----------
Again, this is well explained by e.g. `the Machine`_, but here’s a quick summary:

Teleportation\ [#instant-tele]_ rips you apart atom/molecule by atom/molecule and puts you back together.
Or in most variants, it doesn’t even use the same pieces, but entirely different ones.
Being turned into a fine dust is usually called “dying”, so isn’t that the case here?

Different media use different thought experiments to drive the point home,
like waiting a bit before dissolving the original,
maybe long enough to ask them how they feel about being misted in a few seconds.

The final question is “who is that ‘you’ arriving at the other side?”
Is it really you? Or a person thinking they’re you?
Intuitively, there’s a difference, right?

The issues
----------
Me enjoying these pieces of media doesn’t mean that they don’t have their issues.
Chief among them is equating an interruption of consciousness with sleep;
neurons fire even in dreamless sleep, so despite sleep being held as *the* example for loss of consciousness, mental activity doesn’t cease, it just changes.
Yet a simple twist can fix that: cryonics.
A frozen brain really truly has no consciousness, yet if it’s possible for a `wood frog`_ to wake up from being frozen, it’s believable that we could, too.

Then who are “you”?
Are you the same person you were 10 years ago? 20 years ago? At birth?
A lot of people acknowledge that they’re not,
yet due to continuity of consciousness,
there is no clear boundary between the person they were back then and the person they are now.

The illusion
------------
This perceived continuity is what makes the “teleportation is death” idea intuitive.
But where does the continuity exist but in your perception?
You’re no longer toddler-you, so isn’t a perfect copy of your every atom more “you” than that?
“No” many keep insisting, there’s *something* continuing onwards:
are we not all trapped in our own head and body,
isn’t there an “I” that keeps existing, an “I” that other person wouldn’t have?
This is the illusion this article sets out to dispell.

To start with, it is completely possible to be awake without feeling your “I”.
Unfortunately the term “ego death” has been mysticized by many,
but one of the effects described by the term is exactly this temporary loss of the continuous “I”:
are you sure that this feeling is what makes you alive if it can be suspended and resumed?

If the answer is yes, allow me to propose a final thought experiment.
It utilizes the common philosophical idea of the Ship of Theseus.
Imagine technology existed to
1. simulate a complete human brain in a computer, and
2. interface with a good chunk of the hundreds of trillions of synapses in the human brain.
Imagine that someone uses both to ablate your brain slice by slice,
all while building a copy of what they removed,
allowing that copy to interface with your meat brain’s remainder.
You would keep thinking uninterruptedly throughout the process,
as every remaining neuron would send and receive the exact same signal as if the rest of your brain was still there.
When would you “die” and when would “another person thinking they’re you” form in the simulation?
Or would there just be you?

All of the above are philosophical ramblings,
but I am not the first one to come up with this idea.
If you are not convinced and would like to read a scientifically-backed version of my argument,
`the illusion of the self`_ has a whole book further reading!
