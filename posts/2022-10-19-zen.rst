Inspired by the `zen of Python`_.

#. Automatic code formatting saves you from wasting time discussing the color of the bikeshed
#. but when thatâ€™s impossible, bikeshedding beats unreadable code
#. An automated workflow is a documented workflow
#. but documentation is not automatically good
#. Sometimes repetition is better to understand than DRY
#. but you only need to hear that years after you stopped copying code snippets
